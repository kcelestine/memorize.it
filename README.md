# Memorize Game
[kcelestine.github.io/memorize.it](https://kcelestine.github.io/memorize.it/) 

#### The goal
A simple app that allows users to remember a list of things.

#### Currently
- very bad javascript
- works for only one array
- unlimitesd time

##### Future
- fix bad js code
- use a timer for the user to see how long it took
- select different lists
- upload a list

##### Some ideas on how the game could work
- have the user type in the whole list and see how long it takes
- give the user a select time to see how much they can type in that time
- start the user somewhere random in the list and have them type the next 10 entries within 60 seconds
